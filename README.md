North Texas Volleyball Stats UI is a single-page experience for managing clubs, players, and stat exports. Data stays in your browser via `localStorage`.

## Features
- Landing page hero with snapshot of club and player counts.
- Add clubs and players, with players linked to clubs.
- CSV export of players and stats for spreadsheet workflows.
- CSV import to update stats or bulk-load data using the same column format.

## Getting started
Open `index.html` in your browser to start adding data. Use the export button to download a CSV template and the import input to bring updates back in.
